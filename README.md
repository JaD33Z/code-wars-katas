Codewars is a community-created online platform to practice code challenges. It's definitely my favorite coding
site. It has an awesome community with a high standard of quality, content and behavior that is consistently maintained and adheared to.
Challenges are refered to as 'kata', there is ranks called 'kyus', clans, an honor system, etc.
If you are familiar with martial arts, you get the idea. It's a cool theme. The katas are a system of individual training exercises for
various techniques available in many languages. Kata are ranked by difficulty level. I assure you, no matter how high your skill level, 
there's plenty there to really test you. You are given a text based summary of the backstory, the issue at hand that needs to be solved, and a couple test 
case examples. Even the 'easiest' level challenges can be quite hard. One certainly has to earn their rank. As users complete harder kata, 
they progress through the ranks. These challenges are created and tested by community members, you are granted the privilege to write katas once you have reached a certain level.
 Answers are run through a pretty extensive amount of tests. When a member solves a kata your solution is posted and you can compare with others.
Challenges are often discussed, people leave constructive feedback on the challenge, and ask and answer questions. 
The leaders moderate the content and community to ensure it is accurate and safe. It's interesting to see all the different approaches and 
individual solutions to the same problem. It's a super cool platform, I highly enjoy it. It's a great tool to learn from and improve your coding skills with creative problem solving. 
Anyways, here are a few of the katas that I've completed and my solutions to them. Enjoy!
